        related to any national and international sports comes under this
        category. If you want to read the latest news update daily and news
        related to all categories then you can find it on the website of
        Mydigitalnews.in . It is a growing Digital News of India. There are many
        types of news. I’m sure I’ll miss a few, but this is a list of some of
        the various categories in news, namely in newspapers: “Hard” news: Your
        traditional news of the day. This includes crime stories, political
        stories, education news, city council news, etc. Sports news: Pretty
        self-explanatory; sports news includes news about the sports world.
        Feature News: Feature stories profile individuals or organizations and
        tend to be written in narrative style rather than the traditional
        inverted pyramid or martini glass styles of other news. Feature stories
        focus on the people aspect of the story, rather than simply answering
        the five W and the H questions. Columns/Editorials: Columns and
        editorials are often separate from the rest of the newspaper because
        they are opinion pieces. Columns are personal opinions about whatever
        topic the columnist writes about, while editorials consist of the
        collective opinion of the newspaper’s editorial board.
